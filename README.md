# CeLSIUS
The Centre for Longitudinal Study Information and User Support (CeLSIUS) is funded by the ESRC (project ES/V003488/1) to provide free guidance and support to academic, voluntary and public sector users of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Longitudinal Study (LS). As part of this support we have set up this GitHub site to provide ONS LS users access to a series of syntax files that enable them to create variables that are often derived by other users of the ONS LS.

The syntax has been written by CeLSIUS unless stated in the README files at the start of each of the repositories. Also contained in the README is the list of variables that you will need to ensure are in your dataset before you use the syntax, and a summary of what the syntax does. You will need to check the syntax to ensure that it does what you require. Although the syntax has been checked, this does not mean that it will do what is required for your purpose. You may need to adapt it to your needs.

By setting up this GitHub site we hope that users of the LS will share code that they have written over the course of their LS research project and that they think other LS users will find useful.

Please email celsius@ucl.ac.uk if you have any questions or suggestions related to syntax that we have provided.


## Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (ONS LS)
The ONS LS contains census and life events data, linked between five successive censuses, beginning in 1971. The sample is of people living in England and Wales who were born on one of four selected dates of birth, i.e. 4 out of 365 days of the year, so it makes up about 1% of the total population. The sample was updated at the 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 Censuses and in registrations of life events such as deaths, births to sample mothers, emigrations and cancer registrations. New LS members enter the study through birth and immigration and existing members leave through emigration or death, however their data is retained. The LS now includes records for over 1,100,000 individuals.

Census information is also included for all people living in the same household as the LS member at the time of the census. This means that the people living in the same household as an LS member may change over the course of the study. For example, in childhood the other household members may include the LS member's parents and siblings, but later on in the study, it may include their partner and children.However, the LS does not follow up household members in the same way from census to census.
