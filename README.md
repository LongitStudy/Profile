# Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (ONS LS)
The ONS LS contains census and life events data, linked between five successive censuses, beginning in 1971. The sample is of people living in England and Wales who were born on one of four selected dates of birth, i.e. 4 out of 365 days of the year, so it makes up about 1% of the total population. The sample was updated at the 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 Censuses and in registrations of life events such as deaths, births to sample mothers, emigrations and cancer registrations. New LS members enter the study through birth and immigration and existing members leave through emigration or death, however their data is retained. The LS now includes records for over 1,100,000 individuals.

Census information is also included for all people living in the same household as the LS member at the time of the census. This means that the people living in the same household as an LS member may change over the course of the study. For example, in childhood the other household members may include the LS member's parents and siblings, but later on in the study, it may include their partner and children.However, the LS does not follow up household members in the same way from census to census.
